# Common Prgogramming Concepts 
- Variables: let x = 5;
  - Defines a variable x with a value of 5.
- Data Types: let y: f64 = 3.14;
  - Declares y as a floating-point number.
- Functions: fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 { a + b }
  - Defines a function add that returns the sum of two integers.
- Control Flow: if x > 10 { println!("x is greater than 10"); }
  - Executes a block of code if x is greater than 10.
- Comments: // This is a single-line comment
  - // (Double slash) Adds a comment to the code.
