# Common Prgogramming Concepts 
- Variables:
  ```bash let x = 5; ```
  - Defines a variable x with a value of 5.
- Data Types:
  ```bash let y: f64 = 3.14; ```
  - Declares y as a floating-point number.
- Functions:
  ```bash fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 { a + b } ```
  - Defines a function add that returns the sum of two integers.
- Control Flow:
  ```bash if x > 10 { println!("x is greater than 10"); } ```
  - Executes a block of code if x is greater than 10.
- Comments:
  ```bash // This is a single-line comment```
  - // (Double slash) Adds a comment to the code.
