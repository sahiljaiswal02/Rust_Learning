# An Example Program Using Structs ( Area of Rectangle)
> Finding area of rectangle
### Using basic function
> The area function is supposed to calculate the area of one rectangle, but the function we wrote has two parameters, and itâ€™s not clear anywhere in our program that the parameters are related.
  ```rust
  fn main() {
      let width1 = 30;
      let height1 = 50;
  
      println!(
          "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
          area(width1, height1)
      );
  }
  fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -> u32 {
      width * height
  }
  ```
Output: 
```bash
The area of the rectangle is 1500 square pixels.
```

### Using Tuple
> We would have to keep in mind that width is the tuple index 0 and height is the tuple index 1. This would be even harder for someone else to figure out and keep in mind if they were to use our code
  ```rust
  fn main() {
      let rect1 = (30, 50);
  
      println!(
          "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
          area(rect1)
      );
  }
  fn area(dimensions: (u32, u32)) -> u32 {
      dimensions.0 * dimensions.1
  }
  ```
Output: 
```bash
The area of the rectangle is 1500 square pixels.
```

### Using Struct
> This gives the proper clarity that width and height are related to each other, and it gives descriptive names to the values rather than using the tuple index values of 0 and 1.
  ```rust
  struct Rectangle {
      width: u32,
      height: u32,
  }
  fn main() {
      let rect1 = Rectangle {
          width: 30,
          height: 50,
      };
  
      println!(
          "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
          area(&rect1)  // we want to borrow the struct rather than take ownership of it
      );
  }
  fn area(rectangle: &Rectangle) -> u32 {
      rectangle.width * rectangle.height
  }
  ```
Output: 
```bash
The area of the rectangle is 1500 square pixels.
```

### Adding Useful Functionality with Derived Traits
>  It shows the values of all the fields for this instance, which would definitely help during debugging.
  ```rust
  struct Rectangle {
      width: u32,
      height: u32,
  }
  
  fn main() {
      let rect1 = Rectangle {
          width: 30,
          height: 50,
      };
  
      println!("rect1 is {}", rect1); 
  
  }
  ```
> This will thorugh an error
```rust
error[E0277]: `Rectangle` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`
```
> To remove the error we add an attribute
```rust
 #[derive(Debug)]  // we add the outer attribute #[derive(Debug)] just before the struct definition
```
> Now the output will be:
  ```bash
  cargo run
     Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
      Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48s
       Running `target/debug/rectangles`
  rect1 is Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 }
  ```
