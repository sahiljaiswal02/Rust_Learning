# Enums and Pattern Matching
> Enums are a type that can have a fixed set of possible values, each known as a variant.

> Enums are used to represent a value that can be one of several predefined options, which can make your code more readable and safer.

## What is `Option`?
> `Option` is a special enum that represents a value that can be either `Some(value)` or `None`, effectively encoding the concept of an optional value.

## Pattern Matching with Enums
> `match` expression to execute different code based on the enum variant.
  
## Using the `if let` Construct
> `if let` is a concise syntax for handling enums when youâ€™re interested in one specific variant.
