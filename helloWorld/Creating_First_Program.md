# Getting Started with Rust

Welcome to your first Rust project! This guide will walk you through initializing a new Rust project and running a basic program.

## Project Initialization

To start with Rust, you'll need to create a new Rust file and write a simple program. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Create a New Rust File**

   Create a file named `main.rs`. This file will contain your Rust code.

2. **Write Your First Program**

   Open `main.rs` and add the following code:

   ```rust
   fn main() {
       println!("Hello, World!");
   }
  ```
