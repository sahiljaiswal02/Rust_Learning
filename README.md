## Why Rust ?

Rust is designed to be:

- **Blazing Fast and Memory Efficient:** Rust provides high performance without relying on a runtime or garbage collector.
- **Memory and Thread Safe:** Its ownership model and rich type system prevent many common bugs by ensuring memory and thread safety at compile time.
- **Well-Documented with Excellent Tooling:** Rust comes with extensive documentation, a helpful compiler, and a suite of powerful tools including:
  - **Cargo:** Integrated package manager and build tool
  - **Editor Support:** Smart multi-editor support with features like auto-completion and type inspections
  - **Auto-formatter:** For consistent code formatting and more
